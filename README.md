# Autonomous-Warehouse
## Basics
The system consists of two seperate projects:
	### aw-pc
	This is the PC section of the project.

	aw-pc is run using 'Controllers', these currently include the main Controller 'MultiRobotController' as well as a more simple Controller 'SingleRobotController'.

	### aw-rob
	This is the ROBOT section of the project.

	Uploading code to the robot is as simple as connecting to the appropriate robot via USB (Libusb) or Bluetooth (Bluecove) and then running the Robot class.
